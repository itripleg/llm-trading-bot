    "justification": "Initial market assessment shows mixed signals. Current price (47273) is above 20-EMA (46328) indicating short-term bullish momentum, but RSI-7 at 42.03 suggests recent weakness. Price action shows high volatility with a recent peak at 48207 followed by a pullback. MACD is positive at 9.44 but declining from 17.89, indicating potential momentum loss. The 4H 20-EMA (46328) above 50-EMA (45382) confirms intermediate uptrend. However, given this is my first analysis with no trading history, I prefer to observe one more data cycle to confirm: (1) whether support holds at the 20-EMA level around 46328, (2) if RSI stabilizes or continues declining, and (3) MACD direction. The funding rate at 0.0001 is neutral. With $10k capital and no established risk parameters yet, waiting for clearer confirmation is prudent risk management. Will look for either a clear break above 48200 with RSI recovery above 50, or a bounce off 46300 support with bullish divergence to enter long."
