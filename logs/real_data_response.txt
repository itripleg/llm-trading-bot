    "justification": "HOLDING for clearer setup. Current analysis shows: (1) Price at 98902 is below EMA20 (99306), indicating short-term bearish momentum. (2) MACD at -210.91 is deeply negative and deteriorating (-130 to -210 over last 30min), confirming bearish pressure. (3) RSI(7) at 38.14 is approaching oversold but not extreme - dropped from 60 to 38 rapidly. (4) Price dropped ~850 points (0.85%) in 30 minutes from 99748 to 98902. (5) Volume is extremely low (54 vs avg 240), suggesting this move lacks conviction and could be a fakeout. (6) 4H context shows price near equilibrium (EMA20: 99306 vs EMA50: 99427), not a strong trend. (7) Funding rate at 0.0001 is neutral. RISKS: Entering short here risks catching a falling knife into oversold bounce. Entering long risks continuation of breakdown. With only $10k capital and 0 minutes of trading history, I need HIGH CONFIDENCE setups. Current setup lacks: (1) Volume confirmation, (2) Clear support/resistance levels, (3) RSI divergence or extreme readings, (4) Trend clarity on higher timeframes. WAITING for: RSI to reach <30 for potential long bounce, or price to break and retest a level with volume confirmation. First trade should be high probability, not rushed."
